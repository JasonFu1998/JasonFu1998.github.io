  abstract = {Panoramic images have advantages in information capacity and scene stability due to their large field of view (FoV). In this paper, we propose a method to synthesize a new dataset of panoramic image. We managed to stitch the images taken from different directions into panoramic images, together with their labeled images, to yield the panoramic semantic segmentation dataset denominated as SYNTHIA-PANO. For the purpose of finding out the effect of using panoramic images as training dataset, we designed and performed a comprehensive set of experiments. Experimental results show that using panoramic images as training data is beneficial to the segmentation result. In addition, it has been shown that by using panoramic images with a 180 degree FoV as training data the model has better performance. Furthermore, the model trained with panoramic images also has a better capacity to resist the image distortion. Our codes and SYNTHIA-PANO dataset are available: https://github.com/Francis515/SYNTHIA-PANO.},

  abstract = {Dance improvisation is an active research topic in the arts. Motion analysis of improvised dance can be challenging due to its unique dynamics. Data-driven dance motion analysis, including recognition and generation, is often limited to skeletal data. However, data of other modalities, such as audio, can be recorded and benefit downstream tasks. This paper explores the application and performance of multimodal fusion methods for human motion recognition in the context of dance improvisation. We propose an attention-based model, component attention network (CANet), for multimodal fusion on three levels: 1) feature fusion with CANet, 2) model fusion with CANet and graph convolutional network (GCN), and 3) late fusion with a voting strategy. We conduct thorough experiments to analyze the impact of each modality in different fusion methods and distinguish critical temporal or component features. We show that our proposed model outperforms the two baseline methods, demonstrating its potential for analyzing improvisation in dance.},
